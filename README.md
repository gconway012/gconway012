## About Me

* I'm a veteran who transitioned out of the military and is now trying to enter the world of Data Analytics and Data Science.  

* Like the sidebar shows, I enjoy using this area for projects to:
    + keep up with skills learned
    + learn & practice with new tools and/or associated features
    + learn & practice with analytics concepts
    + share things I've learned that were helpful
    + (eventually) collect/aggregate books, articles, blogposts, etc from others' repos for reference
